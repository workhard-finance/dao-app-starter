      <p>
        Work Hard Finance (WHF) empowers contributors with the choice to be
        compensated now, in stablecoins, or in the future via liquid stock
        options. We introduce a novel “Commit Mining” framework for
        organizations to fairly compensate its contributors by tokenizing any
        revenue stream. It's a collision of recent innovations in programmable
        money, open source development, and decentralized governance to
        reimagine an alternate future of work.
