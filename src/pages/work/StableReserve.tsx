                <strong>What can I do with $COMMIT?</strong>
              </h5>
              <p>
                Contributors get compensation by $COMMIT instead of $DAI, but
                they still can redeem for $DAI as the stable reserve always
                reserves enough $DAI for the redemption. Otherwise, you can
                choose to burn to get $VISION emission. Around 40~50% of the
                total VISION emission goes to whom contributed to the protocol.
                As contributors burn their $COMMIT to get $VISION, the Stable
                Reserve has extra $COMMIT that can be paid to other
                contributors. Therefore, the mechanism between $VISION and
                $COMMIT works like a liquid stock option.
                <br />
                <br />
                In conclusion, if you need money right now redeem $COMMIT for
                $DAI at the Stable Reserve. Or if you believe in the success of
                this protocol, choose to burn your $COMMIT to get more $VISION.
              </p>
              <h5>
                <strong>Why $COMMIT is pegged between $1 ~ $2?</strong>
              </h5>
              <p>
                Although, you can earn $COMMIT by contributing to the protocol,
                you can also buy them via secondary markets like Sushiswap. As a
                big portion of $VISION emission goes to $COMMIT burners, $COMMIT
                price can be overheated in the market. By the way, it is nice
                for you that your $COMMIT deserves more than 1 $DAI. However,
                Stable Reserve also offers an option to buy $COMMIT directly
                through it with the price of $2 DAI per 1 COMMIT. So, if $COMMIT
                gets too expensive, people can do arbitrage between the reserve
                and the secondary markets and the Stable Reserve can mint more
                $COMMITs for grants.
