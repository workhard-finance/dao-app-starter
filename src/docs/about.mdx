## What is Workhard Finance?

Work Hard Finance (WHF) empowers contributors with the choice to be compensated now,
in stablecoins, or in the future via liquid stock options. We introduce a novel “Commit Mining”
framework for organizations to fairly compensate its contributors by tokenizing any revenue stream.
It's a collision of recent innovations in programmable money, open source development,
and decentralized governance to reimagine an alternate future of work.
